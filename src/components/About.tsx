                    <p>
                        I am an artist from Oslo, Norway. Wtf do you write here.
                        The big one in the picture is me. Actually im just
                        Emma's boyfriend writing this right now. It's currently
                        the middle of the night, so she is probably asleep.
                        Let's see. I have been up all night working on this
                        website for her portfolio. She is an amazing. That last
                        sentence was actually written by AI. There is an AI tool
                        in my code editor that suggests text as I type. Kinda
                        creepy, but also kinda cool. Anyway, Emma is an amazing
                        artist and you should definitely check out her work! I
                        wrote everything up untill "code editor" just now. The
                        rest was AI again. This text is kinda just for me to see
                        how the UI is gonna look when the actuall text is ready.
                        It's probably gonna take a while tho. No one like to
                        write sections about themselves and put it on websites.
                        No one in my family at least. And yes she count's. We
                        are not married tho. Both of us are 20 years old, so
                        it's maybe a bit early for that. Who knows tho. @ I
                        think I'm gonna stop writing now. This is getting kinda
                        long. Bye! WTF! I went back and edited the text now. The
                        random @ was the start of some text added by the AI
                        again. Not cool bro.
